###How To Make a Simple iPhone Playing Card Game with Multiplayer and Bluetooth
Snap! is an example game by Matthijs Hollemans ([@mhollemans](http://twitter.com/#!/mhollemans/)). it's a part of tutorials on [www.raywenderlich.com](http://www.raywenderlich.com/14618/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-intro-and-challenge) tutarials page. for more information goto the page. 
This is only the implementation of the Part 1 of the tutorial, if you're really interested you can pick it from here, and keep following the tutorials and finalize the game.

I thinks it's a great example to learn the iOS SDK and an even better, method to lern to read Objective-C to make great Rubymotions apps.

### Instruction
There is a xcode probject 'shadow' which respectively contains the XIB files for each UIViewControllers, this should facilitate customizing the UI for the app.
